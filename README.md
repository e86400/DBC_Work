# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
## A Game I Like to Play


    I don't know much about Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but I have learned a few things from playing it the past 9 months or so. Some of those things are:

* It's one of the few PC games I play.
* I am terrible at it.
* Demolition mode is the most fun because there's no pressure.
* If you are bad, you will probably get kicked off by other players.
* If you are too good, you will also get kicked off. 
* Pro players get paid a pretty penny. 
* You can get awarded things like gun skins or buy them with real money. 
* **"Try-hard"** players often get **salty** when they lose.
* I often confuse "CS" to mean **Counter Strike** instead of Computer Science.
